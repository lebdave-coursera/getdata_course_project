# Final Data Frame Columns

**Subject**: *integer*, ID of the subject, values ranging from 1 to 30.

**Activity**: *factor*, activity performed while the data was taken, values being one of:

	* WALKING
	* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	* SITTING
	* STANDING
	* LAYING

**Features** *numeric*: means of the different mean and std features contained in the original data set. For those columns, only the ones ending with -mean() and -std() were taken since those were considered real means and stds of other readings, as opposed to those like meanFreq, which were considered only as normal data.
